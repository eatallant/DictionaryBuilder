# DictionaryBuilder
This is a web application that creates a list of definitions for user defined input. 
The app serves the purpose of increasing my knowledge of web development, specifically in the areas of HTTP requests and building a project with Express/Node.
<br>
Definitions to words are provided by Free Dictionary API. More information can be found [here](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

## Features
The application is currently a bare bones interface to interact with the API. 
One set of definitions is returned (for the noun/verb/adjective, whichever comes first).
<br>
More is coming! Here is a list of upcoming features:
- data persistence
- sorting
- filtering
- definition type selection (part of speech)

## Technical
- Vanilla Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Run the app locally
1. Download the project
2. Navigate to the folder in a terminal window
3. Run node index.js
```
$ node index.js
